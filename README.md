# Stonks Twitter Scanner üìà

This little scripts uses the `tweepy` Python library, which is a wrapper around the Twitter API.
It sets up a listener on the [@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) Twitter account, and automatically detects whenever Elon Musk posts a tweet mentioning the keywords `share`, `stock`, `doge`, and `$`, or any words
that contain any of those strings as substrings.

When a new tweet that meets the conditions is read, this program will automatically e-mail me with the transcript of that tweet. This is a way for me
to always be up to date with stocks that may soon rise in value ü§°

It is hosted on a Heroku dyno and is set to never sleep in order to provide as accurate service as possible.

## Usage and config üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

If you would like to use this yourself, and receive juicy e-mail notifications every time
Elon tweets, you can too! All you have to do is to have a [Twitter Developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en) and update the following environmental variables with your
Twitter API access keys:

```python
# ./src/apiconfig.py

consumer_key = os.getenv('CONSUMER_KEY')
consumer_secret = os.getenv('CONSUMER_SECRET')
access_token = os.getenv('ACCESS_TOKEN')
access_token_secret = os.getenv('ACCESS_SECRET')
```

You will also have to update the following with your own e-mail details:

```python
# ./src/emailsender.py

mail_from = os.getenv('EMAIL_FROM')
mail_to = os.getenv('EMAIL_TO')
mail_pw = os.getenv('EMAIL_PW')
```
You might also have to update the SMTP server and port if you're not using Gmail.

## Deployment üöÄ

Unless you want to keep this program running inside an open terminal instance forever, you should think about
deploying it somewhere. To do this, first find a platform that suits your needs - I am personally using
[Heroku](https://heroku.com), but other alternatives include AWS (EC2 is a good option for this kind of applications),
or DigitalOcean. 

You need to remember to set the same config vars on the server as you've done locally, otherwise
the program won't work. You also need to make sure that you install all the necessary dependencies (tweepy) - on Heroku this is done
by specifying them inside the `requirements.txt` file which Heroku reads with every deployment.

Some platforms also charge differently and offer different types of containers, so make sure you find one that suits your needs and dones't cost much.

## Upcoming features üìÜ

In the feature I (hopefully) would like to integrate this with Amazon SNS which would send
me a text message instead of an e-mail, however the current solution is the
most cost effective one and sufficient for now.
